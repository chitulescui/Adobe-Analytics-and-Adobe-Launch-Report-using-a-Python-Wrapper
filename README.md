# Adobe-Analytics-and-Adobe-Launch-Report-using-API
In order to track elements on a website using Adobe Launch we have to create Data elements and Rules and use them to retrieve the information and process it in Adobe Analytics.
Due to the fact that when we set-up a rule in Adobe Launch we can either store the information through adobe variables or through a custom code(usualy using javascript), we want to 
create a document with all those details to have a better overview about the implementation of the tracking code/rules in that Adobe Launch property.

Gaining access to the whole data we first have to create a project in Adobe Developer Console, to ensure the connection using JWT authentification method and then connect to Adobe Launch API using via a Python Wrapper.
